# Part 2: Story Draft and User Research
Using the outline for my story and the sketches from [Part 1](https://github.com/fmisbah/TSwD-Final-Project/tree/main), I created a draft of the story using Shorthand, which can be viewed [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/fmisbah/index.html)

## User Research
To gather valuable feedback on my story draft, I conducted interviews from people that I believe represent the audience I hope to reach with my story. The goal was to gather actionable insights that could help me make my story more engaging and informative. Although I created the story with the general public in mind, I believe it would be most effectively delivered to policy students and healthcare professionals. Fortunately, at Heinz, I was able to find many experienced and talented graduate students who have worked at the intersection of policy, management and healthcare. All three of them are between the ages of 25-30.
I asked my interviewees the following questions and recorded their answers below:

Q1. Did you think the story came across as coherent?
Student 1: The story was quite clear and concise, with a nice flow from the problem statement to some relevant data points and the recommendations at the end.
Student 2: Yes, I think it was developed nicely.
Q2. What resonated with you about the idea?
Student 1: The story of Anna from Pittsburgh is a nice way to humanize the issue of Americaâ€™s aging population and almost everyone can relate to the story because of someone they know or are related to.
Student 2: I appreciate that the story discusses the quality of life of elderly people and presents a serious case for their protection and well-being. Most humans have elderly loved ones but their care and well-being is a subject that is largely neglected.
Q3. What is something you liked about it?
Student 1: I like how the story frames the question of whether American seniors are actually living better even if they are living longer? It builds curiosity and invites the reader to explore the story further.
Student 2: I think the proposed goals are well-informed and the visualizations are simple and clear.
Q4. What is something that could be improved or added?  
Student 1: I felt that the fact that elderly adults are the smallest population group but the largest group responsible for healthcare spending can be better illustrated through another type of visualization that displays both pieces of information together.
Student 2: The goals should be elaborated into actionable policy recommendations that motivates the target audience to take action.

## Findings
Some of the most valuable findings that I gathered from the interviews are:
1) The story has a sentimental appeal because everyone has elderly loved ones and wish for their well-being. This has motivated me to end the story with an effective call-to-action that motivates the audience to advocate for the rights and protection of our elderly population.
2) The visualizations can be made more impactful with a little bit of tweaking. I like Student 2's recommendation of displaying the contrasting information about the elderly population's disproportionate contribution to national healthcare expensitures into one single visualization.

## Going forward
Next, I plan to use the insights gained from the interviews to further enhance my story. I will work on my visualizations to make them more complimentary to each other and create interest for the reader (perhaps play around with the colours and using persuasion techniques from the Good Charts guide.)
I'll try to create a single visualization that effectively shows the contrast between the proportion of elderly population in the US and the disproportionate burden of healthcare costs that they face.
Furthermore, I plan to create an actionable policy framework for the goals and recommendations I've discussed in the end of the story.
